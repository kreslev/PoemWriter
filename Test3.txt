FROM fairest creatures we desire increase, 
That thereby beauty's rose might never die, 
But as the riper should by time decease, 
His tender heir might bear his memory: 
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, 
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel, 
Making a famine where abundance lies, 
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. 
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament 
And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
Within thine own bud buriest thy content 
And, tender churl, makest waste in. 
Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, 
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, 
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, 
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: 
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies, 
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, 
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes, 
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. 
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, 
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine 
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,' 
Proving his beauty by succession thine! 
This were to be new made when thou art old, 
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest 
Now is the time that face should form another; 
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, 
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. 
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb 
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? 
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb 
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? 
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee 
Calls back the lovely April of her prime: 
So thou through windows of thine age shall see 
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. 
But if thou live, remember'd not to be, 
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend 
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? 
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, 
And being frank she lends to those are free. 
Then, beauteous, why dost thou abuse 
The bounteous largess given thee to give? 
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use 
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? 
For having traffic with thyself alone, 
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive. 
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone, 
What acceptable audit canst thou leave? 
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee, 
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame 
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, 
Will play the tyrants to the very same 
And that unfair which fairly doth excel: 
For never-resting time leads summer on 
To hideous winter and confounds him there; 
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, 
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where: 
Then, were not summer's distillation left, 
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, 
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, 
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was: 
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet, 
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface 
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd: 
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place 
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd. 
That use is not forbidden usury, 
Which happies those that pay the willing loan; 
That's for thyself to breed another thee, 
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one; 
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art, 
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee: 
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart, 
Leaving thee living in posterity? 
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair 
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light 
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye 
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight, 
Serving with looks his sacred majesty; 
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, 
Resembling strong youth in his middle age, 
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, 
Attending on his golden pilgrimage; 
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car, 
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, 
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are 
From his low tract and look another way: 
So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon, 
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? 
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy. 
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly, 
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy? 
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, 
By unions married, do offend thine ear, 
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds 
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. 
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another, 
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering, 
Resembling sire and child and happy mother 
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: 
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one, 
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye 
That thou consumest thyself in single life? 
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die. 
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife; 
The world will be thy widow and still weep 
That thou no form of thee hast left behind, 
When every private widow well may keep 
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind. 
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend 
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; 
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, 
And kept unused, the user so destroys it. 
No love toward others in that bosom sits 
That on himself such murderous shame commits.
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any, 
Who for thyself art so unprovident. 
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, 
But that thou none lovest is most evident; 
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate 
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire. 
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate 
Which to repair should be thy chief desire. 
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind! 
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? 
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind, 
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: 
Make thee another self, for love of me, 
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
?Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
And the mome raths outgrabe. 
Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
The frumious Bandersnatch!
He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
Long time the manxome foe he sought? 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
 And stood awhile in thought. 
And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
And burbled as it came! 
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
He went galumphing back. 
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
He chortled in his joy.
?Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead
There were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"
"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year.
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things:
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings."
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view?
"It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf
I've had to ask you twice!"
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick!"
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one. 
One bright morning in the middle of the night 
two dead boys got up to fight 
Back to back they faced each other 
Drew their swords and shot each other 
A deaf policeman heard the noise 
and ran to save the two dead boys
If you don't believe this lie is true 
ask the blind man, he saw it, too.
